# To prevent multiplications being inferred to DSP64, remove any DSP64 resources from device
# Note, there are no DSP64 in 7t fabric
# This is to counter a current issue in Synplify, which will be resolved in later versions.
# Now MLP72 are treated as DSP/mluts by Synlplify. Can not set blockmults to 0.
# define_global_attribute syn_allowed_resources {blockmults=0}
