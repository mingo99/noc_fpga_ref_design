Release Notes for Ethernet Reference Design RD19
================================================

Version 4.0 - 31st August 2020

    * Compatible with ACE 8.2 and simulation package 8.2
    * Updated all IP files to new I/O designer format
    * Renamed each design top level to match functionality
    * Removed 8x50G Quad Segmented design
    * Added _oen signal outputs for all user signals.
    * Updated Ethernet interface signals

  Known Issues :

    Bus IO
    ------
    The autogenerated _oen signals for any bus output are incorrectly formatted.
    Therefore any bussed IO, (such as o_pkt_num) have to be done as individual signals
    This will be resolved in future ACE releases

    Serdes clks
    -----------
    The serdes clocks are incorrectly included within the generated pdc file
    The signals are therefore added to the top level design to match
    These will be removed in future ACE releases

    200G status signals
    -------------------
    In the 4x25G design, the <subsystem>_200g_tx_ovr_err signal is incorrectly included
    within the generated pdc file
    This will be removed in future ACE releases


Version 3.0 - 22nd June 2020

    * Compatible with ACE 8.1.2.update2
    * Add in 400G designs, 8x50G packet mode and 8x50G Quad mode
    * Added sim package version check

  Known Issues :

    Timing Issues
    -------------
    The 400G quad mode design only achieves 427MHz timing closure. It requires 507MHz.
    The timing will be improved in future releases
    The 400G design has a 44ps hold violation on i_eth_clk
    This issue will be addressed in future releases of ACE
    The 100G design has a 47ps hold violation on i_eth_clk
    This issue will be addressed in future releases of ACE

    Constraints Syntax Issue
    ------------------------
    If the IO Designer files are regenerated, the 
    /src/ioring/ethernet_ref_design_top_ioring.pdc file will need to be edited.
    Bus o_pkt_num[ 0] thru o_pkt_num[ 9] require the space to be removed from their name.
    This is in both the boundary pin and io pad placement.
    This issue will be fixed in future releases of ACE


Version 2.0 - 29th May 2020

    * Compatible with ACE 8.1.2.update1
    * Restructured to be based on Ethernet rates.  Currently 4x25G available.
    * Added timestamp to loopback packets
    * Restructured Ethernet timestamp and flags structures for easier usage.
    * Added documentation of configuration flow

  Known Issues :

    Timing Issue
    ------------
    There is a 42ps hold violation on clock eth_ff1_clk
    This issue will be addressed in future releases of ACE

    Simulation Issue
    ----------------
    When using Mentor Questa the following error message is output
       # ** Error: Read idle cycle is not reading an idle frame
       #    Time: 1247735 ps  Scope: tb_ethernet_ref_design.... i_pcs_64_66
    This error is cause by simulator time ordering.  It is a false flag and can safely be ignored
    This message is not generated when using Synopsys VCS.
    This error message will be fixed in future releases of the ac7t1500 simulation overlay


    Constraints Syntax Issue
    ------------------------
    If the IO Designer files are regenerated, the 
    /src/ioring/ethernet_ref_design_top_ioring.pdc file will need to be edited.
    Bus o_pkt_num[ 0] thru o_pkt_num[ 9] require the space to be removed from their name.
    This is in both the boundary pin and io pad placement.
    This issue will be fixed in future releases of ACE


Version 1.0 - 21st April 2020
    Initial Release.  Compatible with ACE 8.1.2

  Known Issues :

    Timing Issue
    ------------
    There is a 37ps hold violation on clock eth_ff1_clk
    This issue will be addressed in future releases of ACE

    Constraints Syntax Issue
    ------------------------
    If the IO Designer files are regenerated, the 
    /src/ioring/ethernet_ref_design_top_ioring.pdc file will need to be edited.
    Bus o_pkt_num[ 0] thru o_pkt_num[ 9] require the space to be removed from their name.
    This is in both the boundary pin and io pad placement.
    This issue will be fixed in future releases of ACE
